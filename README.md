# Trained image classification & Detection model

This repository contains code for the following Keras models:
- ResNet50
- Inception v3
- Faster R-CNN

Pre-trained weights can be automatically loaded upon instantiation (`weights='imagenet'` argument in model constructor for all image models). Weights are automatically downloaded if necessary, and cached locally in `~/.keras/models/`.

## Examples
